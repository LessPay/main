This Agreement is a contract between you and PayPal and applies to your use of the Services. The terms of the Acceptable Use Policy, and Merchant Gift Vouchers Policy located on the “Legal Agreements” landing page are incorporated by reference into this Agreement and provide additional terms and conditions related to the Services. All future Changes set out in the Policy Update already published on the “Legal Agreements” landing page of the PayPal website at the time you register for the Services are incorporated by reference into this Agreement and will take effect as specified in that Policy Update. The terms of the PayPal MasterCard Rewards Programme are also incorporated by reference into this Agreement and apply to your use of PayPal Credit. A copy of these terms will be provided to you when you are successfully approved for PayPal Credit. The above mentioned documents are “Ancillary Documents” for the purpose of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the Ancillary Documents nor the parts of this Agreement that incorporate the terms of the Ancillary Documents constitute “framework contracts” for the purpose of the EU Payment Services Directive (2007/64/EC ) or any implementation of that directive in the EU or EEA (including, without limitation, the UK Payment Services Regulations 2009). This Agreement, together with other legal terms and legally required disclosures relating to your use of the PayPal Service will be provided to you, at all times on the PayPal website(s) (typically located on the “Legal Agreements” landing page). This information may also be sent to you or appear in places on the PayPal website(s) or otherwise where relevant to your use of the PayPal Services.
